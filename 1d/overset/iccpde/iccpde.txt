We present a hybrid method by combining finite volumes with a meshless method for solving compressible flows. Finite volume method on structured grids is one of the most accurate methods available for solving the equations of fluid dynamics. For complex domains, and problems with moving boundaries, the overset grid approach using finite volumes and structured grids has emerged as a competitive tool. In this method, it is necessary to interpolate the solution from one grid to another grid since the stencil is incomplete at the boundary of the grids. In this work we propose to replace this interpolation step with a meshless update that is consistent with the underlying partial differential equation. We show that the hybrid scheme is stable and leads to an accurate scheme. We apply the proposed methodology to model conservation laws and to compressible flows governed by Euler equations of gas dynamics.
