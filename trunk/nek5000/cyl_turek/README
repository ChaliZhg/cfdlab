cylinder in channel test case

This is testcase 2D-2 (Re = 100) taken from

Benchmark Computations of Laminar Flow Around a Cylinder
M. Schafer and S. Turek
http://www.mathematik.tu-dortmund.de/lsiii/cms/papers/SchaeferTurek1996.pdf

The mesh was generated using gmsh and karman.geo and it was preprocessed using prex.

To run this in serial, you may need to increase "lelt" in file "SIZE" to about 1900.  For parallel computations with atleast two processors, the default value should suffice.

serial run:

nekb cyl

parallel run with 12 procs:

nekbmpi cyl 12

or using pbs

nekpbs cyl 12

To see strouhal number, do

grep Strou cyl.log

Strouhal number is in column three and this should be about 0.3
