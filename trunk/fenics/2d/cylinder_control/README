Cylinder in unbounded domain

* Create grid by running makefile

   $ make

* Compute unsteady solution

   $ python ns_picard.py
 
* Compute stationary solution

   $ python steady.py

Open u.pvd file in paraview or u#.vtu files in visit. The last solution will be also saved in steady.xml file.

* Compute eigenvalues. There are two codes, one using slepc and another using scipy.

   $ python eig_slepc.py

Open eig.pvd file in paraview or the eig#.vtu files in visit.
