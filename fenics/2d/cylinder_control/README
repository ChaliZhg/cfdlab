Cylinder in unbounded domain

1. Create grid by running makefile

$ make

2. Compute stationary solution

$ python steady.py

Open u.pvd file in paraview or u#.vtu files in visit. The last solution will be also saved in steady.xml file.

3. Compute eigenvalues. There are two codes, one using slepc and another using scipy.

$ python eig_slepc.py

Open eig.pvd file in paraview or the eig#.vtu files in visit.
