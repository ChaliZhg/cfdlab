2-d meshless solver for scalar advection equation on a rectagular domain with
periodic boundary conditions in both x and y-directions.

* Cartesian point distribution
* Points coordinates can be perturbed
* Standard four-point stencil (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1)
* MUSCL reconstruction
* Advection velocity can be set in AdvecVel.f by introducing a new veltype.
* Initial condition can be set in the function InitCond in file SetInitCond.f 
  by introducing a new ictype.
* If you have gnuplot and gifsicle, you can generate an animation, see the
  variables makeanim and animinterval.

COMPILATION

Check the fortran compiler variable FC in "makefile"
Then, type "make" to compile. It compiles all the *.f files in the directory.
So make sure you do not drop in any irrelevant or duplicate files.
