This is a vertex-based finite volume solver for Euler and Navier-Stokes
equations with Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model. It has two cell-types:
median cell and barth/diamond cell. The median cell is obtained by joining
the centroid of each triangle to the mid-point of its three sides. The barth
cell is obtained by:
1. joining the circumcenter to the mid-point of the three sides for an acute
   angled triangle
2. joining the mid-point of the largest side to the other two sides for a
   right-angled or obtuse-angled triangle

For an acute angled triangle the barth cell coincides with the voronoi
tessellation.

Currently, two flux function are supported: Roe and KFVS. Higher order
accuracy is obtained using linear reconstruction and an edge-based van
Albada-type limiter. For slip walls, the boundary condition is enforced weakly
by satisfying the flux boundary condition. For no-slip walls the velocity is
explicitly set to zero. Time-stepping is performed using a 3-stage scheme of Shu
and Osher but the code is not time accurate since the mass matrix is lumped.

Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model is used for calculating turbulent viscosity.
The convective terms are discretized with first order upwinding and diffusion
terms by Galerkin approximation. The destruction term is treated in a
semi-implicit manner.

counter-clockwise order.

Output files
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All output files are named in capital letters to distinguish them from other
files. The grid is written into GRID.DAT and DUAL.DAT, and the boundary is in
BD.DAT all of which can be visualized using gnuplot. The results are written
in three different formats for visualization with gnuplot, vigie and MayaVi
(actually vtk format).

The gnuplot files are:
GNU.PRES -> Pressure contours
GNU.MACH -> Mach number contours
GNU.VISC -> Turbulent viscosity contours
GNU.VECT -> Velocity vectors

For example, you can visualize the contours by typing

gnuplot> set size ratio -1
gnuplot> plot "GNU.PRES" w l,"BD.DAT" w l

The vigie and MayaVi files are RESULT.VIG and RESULT.VTK respectively. These
files are written at the very end of the program. If the solver crashes in
between for some reason then these files wont be written. A file PARAM.DAT is
written at the end which contains some information on the converged solution.

For visualizing contours with MayaVi you can type

$ mayavi -d RESULT.VTK -f PolyDataNormals -f UserDefined:vtkFeatureEdges \
         -m SurfaceMap -M new -m SurfaceMap

Wall data is written into WALL.DAT
For inviscid flow it contains

<x coordinate>  <-Cp>

while for viscous flows it contains

<x coordinate>  <-Cp>  <Cf>  <y for first layer>  <y+ for first layer>
