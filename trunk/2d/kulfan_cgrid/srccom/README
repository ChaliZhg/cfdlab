                          GRID GENERATION LIBRARY

                       (c) Jiri Blazek, December 2000

********************************************************************************

Collection of subroutines needed for the 2-D grid generation codes "cgrid",
"channel" and "hgrid". The subroutines are compiled and linked into a library
called "libgrid.a".

  How to compile "libgrid.a"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit first the flags (SRC, EXEC, O, LD, FC, FFLAGS, and LDFLAGS) in "Makefile"
as appropriate for your computer, compiler and/or operating system. There are
examples of settings for GNU g77, Mac OS X, IBM, SGI and SUN f77 compilers. Type
"make" at the prompt to compile the subroutines and to create the library. All
object files and the library can be deleted by "make clean".
