"$" denotes the shell prompt where you enter the commands.
"<" denotes input that you have to provide.

1. $ genbox
   < domain.box

2. $ mv box.rea dipole.rea

3. $ genmap
   < dipole

4. $ makenek dipole

5. $ nek dipole
   (You may want to run this in parallel.)

Total KE and entropy are written into the log files. To make plots of them 

./global.sh

Then see the ke.eps and enstrophy.eps file. You can obtain the data in the ke.dat and enstrophy.dat files.
